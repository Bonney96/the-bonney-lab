# The Bonney Lab Digital Garden

A digital garden for sharing evolving ideas and knowledge. This repository contains the source code and content for The Bonney Lab, a place where ideas grow from seeds to fruits.

## About The Bonney Lab

The Bonney Lab is a digital garden dedicated to the continuous learning and sharing of knowledge. Unlike traditional blogs where articles are published in a finished state, this space embraces the evolving nature of ideas.

Here, you'll find:
- Raw thoughts (Seeds)

- Refined ideas (Fruits)
