# Ideas for Future Research

This is a collection of potential research directions that I'm considering exploring in the future. These are unrefined thoughts that need further development.

## Potential Areas

- How does digital gardening influence knowledge retention compared to traditional note-taking?
- The relationship between non-linear note organization and creative thinking
- Applying complexity theory to knowledge management systems
- Comparative analysis of digital garden platforms and methodologies
- The role of bi-directional linking in knowledge synthesis

## Questions to Explore

- What metrics could measure the "health" or "fertility" of a digital garden?
- How do different visualization techniques affect understanding of knowledge networks?
- Is there a correlation between note interconnectedness and idea innovation?
- How does public versus private gardening affect note quality and development?

## Resources to Investigate

- Need to find studies on knowledge management effectiveness
- Look into tools for network analysis of notes
- Research cognitive science papers on information connectivity
- Identify experts in this domain for potential interviews
