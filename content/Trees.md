# ðŸŒ¿ Trees

Trees are ideas that have taken root and are developing structure. These notes have grown beyond their initial seed state and have started to form meaningful connections.

## What Makes a Tree?

Tree notes:
- Have clear organization and sections
- Connect to other related notes
- Show evidence of research and refinement
- May still be evolving but have a stronger foundation

## All Trees

## Nurturing Trees

Trees are developing but still need care to reach their full potential as fruits. Here are ways to nurture tree-stage ideas:

- Strengthen the structure with clear sections and headings
- Add more substantive content and evidence
- Develop stronger connections to other notes
- Address gaps or inconsistencies
- Refine the language and presentation
