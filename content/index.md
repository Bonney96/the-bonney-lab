# Welcome to The Bonney Lab Digital Garden

This is a place to share ideas and notes with the public. It follows the concept of Learning in Public and allows for publishing a collection of evolving ideas and thoughts.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A Digital Garden is like a laboratory where internal work and the evolution of research are displayed for the public to see. There are three stages in a digital garden:

- **Seeds**: Raw ideas. Plant seeds in your mind garden by taking smart personal notes.
- **Trees**: Grow your seed by forming new branches — connecting related ideas. Write structured, concise notes to publish in your digital garden. One note = One idea.
- **Fruits**: Refined, publishable content — essays, videos, or even a book at some point.
