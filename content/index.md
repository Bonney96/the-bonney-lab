# Welcome to The Bonney Lab

This is a research-focused site where I share my projects, ideas, and notes with the scientific community. It follows the concept of Learning in Public, making my research process transparent and accessible.

## Research Focus

The Bonney Lab focuses on computational biology and bioinformatics, with particular emphasis on:

- Epigenetic analysis and prediction
- Machine learning applications in genomics
- Bioinformatics tool development
- Data visualization for complex biological datasets
