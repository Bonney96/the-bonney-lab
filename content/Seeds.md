# ðŸŒ± Seeds

Seeds are raw, nascent ideas that have just been planted. These notes are early in their development - often short, exploratory, and subject to change.

## What Makes a Seed?

Seed notes:
- Capture initial thoughts or questions
- May be incomplete or fragmented
- Often raise more questions than answers
- Invite exploration and development

## Cultivating Seeds

Seeds need nurturing to grow into trees and eventually fruits. Here are some ways to cultivate seed ideas:

- Add more structure and organization
- Research related concepts
- Explore connections to other notes
- Find supporting evidence or examples
- Revisit and refine regularly

*Seeds represent the beginning of the knowledge journey. They're valuable because they capture ideas before they're fully formed.*
