# Research Documentation Principles

## Summary
This note outlines core principles for effective research documentation and knowledge management in scientific work. These principles aim to improve research quality, reproducibility, and collaboration.

## Core Principles

### 1. Comprehensive Documentation
Thorough documentation of methods, data, and analyses is essential for reproducibility and knowledge transfer.

**Application**: Create detailed protocols, document code with comments, and maintain clear records of experimental parameters.

### 2. Version Control
Tracking changes to research materials over time preserves the history of development and enables collaboration.

**Application**: Use version control systems like Git for code, protocols, and documentation.

### 3. Structured Organization
Logical organization of research materials makes information retrieval efficient and reduces cognitive load.

**Application**: Implement consistent file naming conventions, directory structures, and metadata standards.

### 4. Interconnected Knowledge
Research insights often emerge from connections between different concepts, experiments, or fields.

**Application**: Create cross-references between related documents, use tags to categorize content, and maintain a network of linked notes.

### 5. Public Sharing
Open science principles encourage sharing research processes and outputs when appropriate.

**Application**: Publish preprints, share code repositories, and document methods publicly while respecting privacy and intellectual property considerations.

## Implementation Guidelines

For effective research documentation:

1. **Start early**: Begin documenting from the inception of a project rather than retrospectively
2. **Be consistent**: Establish and follow conventions for formatting, organization, and metadata
3. **Focus on clarity**: Write for your future self and collaborators who may not have your current context
4. **Integrate with workflow**: Choose documentation tools that enhance rather than impede your research process
5. **Regular maintenance**: Schedule time to review, update, and refine documentation

## Applications in Computational Biology

In computational biology and bioinformatics, effective documentation includes:

- Well-commented code with clear explanations of algorithms and parameters
- Comprehensive environment specifications (e.g., using containers or environment files)
- Data provenance tracking and preprocessing documentation
- Visualization of analysis workflows
- Thorough documentation of model architectures and training procedures
