# EpiBench: Bridging the Gap in Epigenetic Analysis

## The Epigenetic Challenge

Epigenetic modifications—such as DNA methylation and histone marks—orchestrate gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These modifications play crucial roles in development, disease progression, and cellular identity. However, analyzing these patterns presents significant challenges:

- Multiple data types must be integrated (DNA sequence, histone modifications, methylation data)
- Complex relationships exist between sequence context and epigenetic state
- Traditional analysis methods often miss subtle patterns across different scales

EpiBench emerged from our need to address these challenges comprehensively, creating a platform that brings together advanced machine learning with biological interpretability.

## What Makes EpiBench Different?

Unlike many existing tools that focus on single aspects of epigenetic analysis, EpiBench provides an end-to-end solution—from data processing to visualization and interpretation:

| Feature | EpiBench | Other Tools (DeepCpG, epiNet, etc.) |
|---------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Multi-modal data integration | ✅ Combines DNA sequence and histone data | ❌ Often limited to single data type |
| Explainable predictions | ✅ Attribution analysis reveals feature importance | ❌ Typically "black box" models |
| Scale-sensitive pattern detection | ✅ Multi-branch CNN architecture detects patterns at various scales | ❌ Fixed architectures with limited scale sensitivity |
| End-to-end workflow | ✅ Complete pipeline from raw data to interpretation | ❌ Typically require multiple tools |
| Interactive visualization | ✅ Browser-based interactive visualizations | ❌ Limited visualization capabilities |

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Sophisticated Data Integration

EpiBench transforms raw genomic data into analysis-ready formats:

- Extracts and processes DNA sequences around regions of interest
- Integrates histone modification signals from BigWig files
- Aligns sequence data with epigenetic signals for comprehensive analysis

### 2. Advanced Machine Learning Architecture

At the heart of EpiBench lies a multi-branch convolutional neural network designed specifically for epigenetic data:

- Parallel CNN branches with different kernel sizes capture patterns at various genomic scales
- Integration layers combine features from different branches
- Deep convolutional layers extract higher-order patterns from integrated representations

### 3. Interpretability and Visualization

EpiBench prioritizes making "black box" predictions transparent:

- Integrated gradients quantify the contribution of each input feature
- Saliency maps visualize influential regions in sequences or histone patterns
- Motif discovery identifies recurring patterns associated with specific epigenetic states

### 4. Comprehensive Reporting

Analysis results are compiled into interactive reports that combine:

- Performance metrics and evaluation statistics
- Interactive visualizations for data exploration
- Downloadable data and model outputs

## The Journey Behind EpiBench

EpiBench didn't emerge fully-formed—it evolved through iterations of development, testing, and refinement.

Early versions focused primarily on DNA sequence analysis, but it became clear that integrating histone modification data significantly improved prediction accuracy. The challenge was creating a unified framework that could process these disparate data types while maintaining interpretability.

The current architecture represents years of experimentation with different neural network designs, feature engineering approaches, and visualization techniques. Each component has been refined based on real-world applications and feedback from epigenetics researchers.

This digital garden will document ongoing improvements and applications as EpiBench continues to evolve.

## Applications and Case Studies

EpiBench has been applied to several research questions:
