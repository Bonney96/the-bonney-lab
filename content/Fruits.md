## Harvesting Fruits

Fruits represent knowledge that has reached maturity, but even mature ideas can be improved:

- Share them with others to get feedback
- Apply the ideas in new contexts
- Update with new research or information
- Consider extracting parts for more focused notes
- Develop them into other formats (articles, talks, etc.)
