# Understanding Growth Stages in The Bonney Lab

In The Bonney Lab digital garden, notes evolve through different growth stages as they mature and develop. This is a key concept in digital gardening - ideas aren't static but grow over time.

## The Three Growth Stages

### 🌱 Seeds
Seeds represent raw, nascent ideas that have just been planted. These notes:
- Are often short and exploratory
- May contain unstructured thoughts
- Frequently change as the idea develops
- Invite discussion and evolution

### 🌿 Trees
Trees are ideas that have taken root and are developing structure. These notes:
- Have clear organization and sections
- Connect to other related notes
- May still be evolving but have a stronger foundation
- Show evidence of research and refinement

### 🍎 Fruits
Fruits are mature ideas that have reached a stable state. These notes:
- Represent well-developed concepts
- Have been extensively refined
- Connect to multiple other notes in the garden
- Can be easily consumed by others

## How to Use Growth Stages

When creating or editing notes in The Bonney Lab, you can specify the growth stage in the frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: Your Note Title
stage: seed  # Can be "seed", "tree", or "fruit"
---
```

The growth stage will be displayed at the top of your note, providing context to readers about the maturity level of the idea.

## The Value of Growth Stages

Tracking growth stages offers several benefits:
1. **Transparency**: Readers understand the maturity of the content
2. **Reduced pressure**: It's okay to publish "seed" ideas that aren't fully formed
3. **Evolution tracking**: Watch ideas develop over time
4. **Organization**: Easily identify which ideas need more cultivation

Remember that digital gardening is about growing ideas in public, so don't be afraid to plant seeds and nurture them into trees and fruits over time!
