# Learning in Public

Learning in Public is the practice of sharing your learning journey and knowledge as you acquire it, rather than waiting until you feel like an "expert." It involves documenting your process, sharing your insights, and engaging with others about what you're learning.

## Why Learn in Public?

### For Others
