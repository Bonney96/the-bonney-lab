# Setting Up a Research Website with Quartz

This guide outlines the steps to set up a research website using Quartz, a static site generator designed for knowledge sharing.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Git and GitHub
- Node.js installed on your computer
- A text editor for editing markdown files

## Step 1: Clone the Quartz Repository

1. Fork the [Quartz repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) on GitHub
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quartz.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd quartz
   ```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Configure Your Site

1. Open `quartz.config.ts` in your text editor
2. Update the configuration settings:
   - Set the `pageTitle` to your research lab or project name
   - Update the `baseUrl` if you plan to host it on a custom domain
   - Configure other settings as needed

## Step 4: Create Content

1. Create markdown files in the `content` directory
2. Use frontmatter at the top of each file to add metadata:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: Your Title
   tags:
     - research
     - bioinformatics
   ---
   ```
3. Organize content in subdirectories for better structure

## Step 5: Preview Your Site

Run the development server to preview your site:

```bash
npx quartz build --serve
```

This will start a local server, typically at http://localhost:8080

## Step 6: Deploy Your Site

### GitHub Pages

1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Set up GitHub Pages in your repository settings
3. Configure GitHub Actions for automatic deployment

### Other Hosting Options

- Netlify
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Pages

## Tips for Research Websites

- **Organize by project**: Create separate sections for each research project
- **Include documentation**: Add detailed documentation for tools and methods
- **Link related content**: Use internal links to connect related research notes
- **Add visualizations**: Include charts, diagrams, and interactive elements
- **Keep it updated**: Regularly update content with new research findings

## Useful Quartz Features

- **Search functionality**: Makes it easy to find specific content
- **Graph visualization**: Shows connections between different notes
- **Tags**: Helps categorize and filter content
- **Responsive design**: Works well on mobile devices
- **Customizable themes**: Allows for personalization
