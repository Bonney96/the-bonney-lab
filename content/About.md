# About The Bonney Lab

## Purpose & Research Focus

The Bonney Lab is dedicated to advancing computational approaches in epigenetics and genomics. My work focuses on developing innovative tools and methodologies that help researchers analyze complex biological data more effectively.

Key research areas include:
- Epigenetic pattern prediction using machine learning
- Integration of multi-modal genomic data
- Development of interpretable AI for biological insights
- Open-source bioinformatics tools

## Current Affiliation

I am currently a Bioinformatics Research Assistant in the Division of Medical Oncology at Washington University in St. Louis (since September 2024). I work in the [David Spencer Lab](https://www.davidspencerlab.org/lab/), where I assist with implementing algorithms and software for analyzing omics-based data sets and developing new analytical methods for large-scale genomic, epigenomic, and clinical datasets.

## Research Philosophy

My approach to research is guided by several core principles:

- **Open Science**: I believe in making research methods, data, and tools openly available to promote collaboration and reproducibility.
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: The most interesting problems exist at the intersection of different fields. I actively seek collaborations across disciplines.
- **Learning in Public**: By sharing my research process, including challenges and failures, I hope to contribute to collective knowledge and invite valuable feedback.
- **Tool-Building**: Creating accessible, well-documented tools that others can use is as important as the research itself.

## Background

[Brief background about yourself - education, research experience, etc.]

## Current Projects

My current focus is on developing EpiBench, an integrated platform for epigenetic analysis that combines machine learning with biological interpretability. You can learn more about this and other projects on the [[Projects]] page.
