# About The Bonney Lab

## Purpose & Philosophy

The Bonney Lab is a digital garden dedicated to the continuous learning and sharing of knowledge. Unlike traditional blogs where articles are published in a finished state, this space embraces the evolving nature of ideas.

Here, you'll find:
- Raw thoughts (Seeds)
- Developing concepts (Trees)
- Refined ideas (Fruits)

## Why a Digital Garden?

Traditional blogs and research articles follow a linear structure and present a complete picture. In contrast, The Bonney Lab allows for documenting ideas in a non-linear fashion, letting them evolve over time.

The benefits include:
- **Continuous Refinement**: Unlike blogs that are written once and forgotten, digital gardens require continuous updates and refinements.
- **Public Knowledge Sharing**: Publishing notes publicly not only helps others but also invites feedback from peers.
- **Idea Visualization**: By linking related notes, we create a clearer understanding of ideas and their connections.

## How to Navigate
